## Adding a package to a Homebrew tap

These example commands will be for the `snowdrift` package.

- Tag the current HEAD
   - `git tag snowdrift-1.0.1 -a`
   - `git tag -l` # View the current tags
   - `git push --tags`
- Add our tap
   - Note that the repo MUST start with `homebrew-`
   - `brew tap platform-analytics/homebrew-tap git@github.comcast.com:platform-analytics/homebrew-tap.git`
- Create a new forumla based on the release (tarball) that corresponds to the tag created above
   - To get the path to the tarball, go to your app's repo, click "releases", click on "tags", then right click on the `tar.gz` link to get that tarball's URL
   - `brew create https://github.com/Comcast/snowdrift/archive/snowdrift-1.0.tar.gz --tap platform-analytics/tap`
- Now, go into our tap's directory:
   - `cd $(brew --repo platform-analytics/tap)`
- Verify that the formula is in the `Formula/` directory
- Test installing that formula
   - `brew install -verbose snowdrift`
   - HINT: If you're installing a script of some kind, you'll want to make use of `bin.install "snowdrift"` in the install method.
- Verify that `snowdrift` executable is present
   - `which snowdrift`
- Audit/test the formula
   - `brew audit snowdrift`
- Now commit this repo and push, optionally by creating a branch and a PR


## Updating a package/adding a new release

These examples will again be for the `snowdrift` package.

- Tag the current head and push the tags
- Go into the tap's directory
   - `cd $(brew --repo platform-analytics/tap)`
- Add a new release tarball
   - `brew edit snowdrift`
   - Get the path to the tarball and update the `url` field in the formula.
- Download the new release:
   - `brew fetch snowdrift --build-from-source`
- Update the SHA256
   - Note the SHA256 displayed when fetching the file, `edit` the formula, and change it to the new value
- Commit and push to GitHub
